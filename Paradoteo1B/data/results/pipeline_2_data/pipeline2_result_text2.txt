During our final discussing, I tells him about the new submissions — the one we are patiently_waiting since earlier spring, but the update is confused as it did include the full feedback from reviewers or probably columnist? Probably, I think the teams, although wee_bit delayed and more communications at recent months, they kinda trying best for paper and mutually_beneficial_cooperation. We should be eternally_grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and effort until the Springer links went finally earlier year, I know. Also, kindly reminds me DMSP_Information, if the dentist still proposal for the acknowledgments sections edit before he send once. Because I didnâ_€_™ ’ hasn_¿ see that part final yet, or probably I misses, I apologizing if really. Overall, letting us made sure all were safer and commemorate the outcome with solid o_joe and future target.
